## 5. Database Setup
Ready to bring your app to life? Let’s get your database up and running in just a few exciting steps! 🚀

1. Choose Your Database Home 🏠
Head over to Render and create a shiny new PostgreSQL database. It’s quick and easy!

2. Grab Your Magic Key 🔑
Once your database is set up, Render will provide you with a connection string. Think of this as the secret handshake to your database—copy it carefully and keep it secure!

3. Plug It In 🔌
Open your db.js file (or equivalent configuration file) and replace the existing credentials with your Render PostgreSQL connection string. This step connects your app to the database.

4. Set Up the movies Table 🎬
Before diving into your API, make sure to create the movies table in your database. You can use the following SQL command to set it up:

SQL
```
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  genre VARCHAR(255),
  release_year INT,
  director VARCHAR(255),
  rating DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```
5. Watch the Magic Happen ✨
No need to fret about migrations—thanks to Sequelize, your tables can be managed automatically. Just ensure the database connection is correct, and you’re good to go!

6. Test the Waters 🌊
Start your server and test the API endpoints to ensure everything is working like a charm. Run some queries, add a few movies, and watch the data flow effortlessly!

## 6. Authentication & Security

- JWT-based authentication (setup in backend).
- Secure your `.env` file and database credentials.
- Always validate inputs on the frontend and backend.

---

## 7. Deployment Guide

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Deploy your backend on Render or any other Node.js-supported platform.
3. Add your environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`) to the Render dashboard.
